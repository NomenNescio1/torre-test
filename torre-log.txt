began wondering if react + axios was a good fit (let's hope it was)
tested endpoints via browser
wondered if there was a way to match users that shared university
scraped that due to very few users having university on their profiles
settled down on matching interests with connections strengths
began testing the endpoints with axios
create react app to consume the endpoints
created the basic front end with the username input field
began testing on console log several ways to fetch the data from the endpoints and understanding the response
working on mapping the endpoints response to have only users connection's ID
then started to think on how to GET the users connections bio
got the bio of the users connections 
made a single object containing connections info and top strength
began working on error management, like when connections don't have strengths on the profile
also considered a case where the user doesn't have interests
will make a switch to act on axios errors
managed to handle errors and fixed interests mapping issue, now working on improving visuals and deployment
fixed git inconsistency
started to work on the styles and the deployment
thinking if there's a way to highlight matching interests with strengths
finishing styles and deployed on a new repo, kept adding details
made so the input is align-center-ed once the app loads and initial when the form is submited
