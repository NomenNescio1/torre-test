began wondering if react + axios was a good fit (let's hope it was)
tested endpoints via browser
wondered if there was a way to match users that shared university
scraped that due to very few users having university on their profiles
settled down on matching interests with connections strengths
began testing the endpoints with axios
create react app to consume the enpoints
created the basic front end with the username input field
began testing on console log several ways to fetch the data from the endpoints and understanding the response
working on mapping the endpoints response to have only users connection's ID
then started to think on how to GET the users connections bio
